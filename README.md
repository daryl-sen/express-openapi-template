# Express Server Template

An express server that uses OpenAPI/Swagger for routing and documentation, and TSOA to automatically generate documentation for API endpoints.

## Why OpenAPI?

OpenAPI automagically generates API documentation, so the project's documentation will always be up to date. Additionally, the Swagger UI allows basic endpoint testing.

## Setup

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Run `yarn run dev` to run development version of this project for local development
3. Open `localhost:3000` to check that the server is running
